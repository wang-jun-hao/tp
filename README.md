## MediBook

![ug](docs/images/Ui.png)

MediBook is a desktop app for managing patient records, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MediBook can get your patient records management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

MediBook aims to increase efficiency in a clinical setting by providing a convenient interface for clinical staff to record and keep track of patient details.
