## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Welcome to MediBook

MediBook is a **desktop medical records software targeting doctors and administrative staffs in clinics or hospitals to 
help manage patient details.** It is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while 
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MediBook can get your patient 
details management tasks done faster than traditional methods.

### 1.2 Overview

This user guide contains everything that you will need to know about MediBook. The information contained in this user guide will be useful to both new and experienced users alike.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about patients in MediBook:**<br>

MediBook stores patients with their personal details, medical details and medical notes. A representation of any
specified patient in MediBook can be added, edited, deleted or found using commands. Here are some things to take note when dealing with patient records in MediBook:
  * The personal detail fields are: `IC`, `NAME`, `DATE_OF_BIRTH`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, `ADDRESS`, `HEIGHT`, `WEIGHT`, `BLOOD_TYPE` and `BMI`.
  `BMI` is the only non-editable field since it is automatically calculated from `HEIGHT` and `WEIGHT`.
  * The medical detail fields are: `ALLERGY`, `CONDITION` and `TREATMENT`.
  * `IC` should be of the format @xxxxxxx#, where @ is a letter S, T, F or G, xxxxxxx is a 7 digit number and # is any letter.
  * `NAME` should only have alphanumeric characters and spaces.
  * `DATE_OF_BIRTH` should be given in the format "DD-MM-YYYY" where D, M and Y represent digits of the day, month and year of the date respectively.
  * `PHONE_NUMBER` has to be within 7 to 15 digits long (to support international numbers).
  * `EMAIL` Emails should be of the format "local-part@domain" and adhere to the following constraints:
    * The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding parentheses, (!#$%&'*+/=?`{&#124;}~^.-").
    * This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name must:
        * be at least 2 characters long
        * start and end with alphanumeric characters
        * consist of alphanumeric characters, a period or a hyphen for the characters in between, if any.
  * `ADDRESS` can take any values but should not be blank.  
  * `HEIGHT` must be a whole number between 1 - 299 inclusive and is measured in cms.
  * `WEIGHT` must be a positive number correct to 1 decimal place and is measured in kgs.
  * `BLOOD_TYPE` must be a valid blood type i.e. one of A, B, O or AB followed by '+' or '-". For example A+, AB- etc.
  * If multiple values for the same personal detail field are given, MediBook accepts the last value. 
    Eg. if you type `add i/S9123456A n/Divakar d/29-02-2000 p/91234567 b/A+ b/O+`, O+ will be accepted as the actual blood type.
  * For medical detail fields i.e. `ALLERGY`, `CONDITION` and `TREATMENT`, any number of entries can be specified, following the given format for each entry.
  All entries will be added. Note that entries are not cumulative over different command instances 
  i.e. when you edit a patient's allergies, all the original allergies will be overwritten (and the same goes for other medical detail fields).

### 3.1 Login and Create Account

#### 3.1.1 Logging In

When you first startup MediBook, you will be presented with the following login screen.

<img src="images/screenshots/login.PNG">

As a **doctor**, you can use all features of MediBook.

If you do not have a `username` and `password`, pick the

As an **administrative staff**, you can only add, edit, delete and find patients. 
You are unable to add, edit or delete medical notes.

#### 3.1.2 Creating Account

When creating your new account, fill in your desired `username`, `password`, your `name` and your `MCR`, then click create.

* `username` and `password` need to be at least 5 characters long.
* `MCR` is your medical registration number as given by the Singapore Medical Council, e.g. 'M35477G'.

  e.g `n/NAME [w/WEIGHT]` can be used as `n/John Doe w/60.5` or as `n/John Doe`.

### 3.3 Charts

MediBook keeps a record of a patient's height and weight. This record can be viewed in chart form when [accessing a patient's profile](#327-accessing-a-patients-profile--access).
[Adding a patient](#323-adding-a-patient-add) or [Editing a patient's profile](#324-editing-a-patient-edit) will automatically update the patient's height and weight records (assuming the height/weight field is not empty).
MediBook only stores the latest height/weight record of the day. This means that only the last edit of the patient's height/weight would be recorded
if a patient's height or weight is edited multiple times within a single day.

MediBook also derives a patient's BMI records based on the patient's height and weight records. As of v1.4, a patient's BMI
record for a particular date can only be derived if the patient also has both the height and weight records on that day.

### 3.4 Data

#### 3.4.1 Saving the data

Patients' data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>

The information contained in this subsection is meant for advanced users. Improper usage of this feature can potentially cause permanent loss of data!

</div>

The MediBook's save data files are stored in the `data` folder which can be found in the home folder which was chosen in [Quick start](#2-quick-start) step 3.
Details of the patients' medical details can be found in `data` --> `medibook.json`. The medical notes for each patient can be found in `data` --> `medicalnotes` --> `IC.json` where `IC` refers to the IC of the patient. Account details can be found in `data` --> `accounts.json`.

The saved data follow the same formatting restriction as stated in the [Features](#3-features) section. If the saved data is edited such that the file or data format becomes invalid, MediBook will reset the data for that particular file, causing data to be lost.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Follow these steps on the new computer:
1. Install the app in the other computer. You may follow the instructions in [Quick start](#2-quick-start) to do so.
2. Run the app and try out any command. This should create a data folder (named **"data"**) in the home folder (that you chose in [Quick start](#2-quick-start)).
3. Replace the data folder on this new computer with that of the first computer.
