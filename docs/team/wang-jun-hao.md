## Project: MediBook

MediBook is a **desktop medical records software** targeting **doctors and administrative staffs** in clinics or hospitals to 
help **manage patient details.** It is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while 
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), implemented using JavaFX.

Main highlights of MediBook include:
* Ability to keep track of patientsâ€™ administrative and medical details
* Ability to store medical consultation notes for each patient
* Displaying of health metric charts such as `BMI`
* Login accounts for doctors for a more streamlined experience (e.g. auto-fill name and medical IC)

**Given below are my contributions to the project.**

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=wang-jun-hao)


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to create/edit/delete medical notes for each patient
  * What it does: Allows users to create, edit and delete medical consultation notes belonging to a patient, when logged in as a doctor
  and viewing a patient profile page. Autofills doctor's and patient's information.
  * Justification: This is a fundamental feature of a medical records software. By only allowing these commands when 
  logged in and viewing a patient profile page, the commands themselves can be streamlined as certain information 
  are automatically retrieved.
  * Highlights: This enhancement took significant effort and required the implementation of many underlying classes, such as `Doctor` and
  `MedicalNoteList`, and established a connection between these classes and `Patient`. It required an in-depth design analysis 
  to reduce coupling and avoid cyclic dependency. The auto-filling feature required the implementation of `ModelContext`.


* **New Feature**: Doctor verification when editing or deleting medical notes
  * What it does: Restricts editing and deleting of medical notes to the doctor who authored them.
  * Justification: Medical notes are important sensitive information that affect treatment decisions. The integrity of
  medical notes should be protected. This feature prevents tampering of medical notes by other doctors.
  * Highlights: This feature interacts with login and model context features to check for account match.


* **New Feature**: Display of medical notes in reverse chronological order


* **New Feature**: Added support for `BMI` for patients
  * What it does: Auto computation and storing of a patient's `BMI` from `Height` and `Weight` fields if present.


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Implemented new `Weight` field for `add` feature (Pull requests [\#26](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/pull/26))
