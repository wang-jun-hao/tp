## **Introduction**
MediBook is a **desktop medical records software targeting doctors and administrative staffs in clinics or hospitals to 
help manage patient details.** It is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while 
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This developer guide helps you get familiar with the architecture design of the program and the implementation details of
main features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](../src/main/java/seedu/medibook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/medibook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/medibook/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PatientListPanel`, `PatientProfile`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/medibook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `PatientListPanel` and `PatientProfile` utilises the same space in the MainWindow. The `Logic` component indicates to MainWindow if there is a need to toggle between the two UI parts based on user commands.

The `PatientProfile` is made up of additional parts inheriting from the abstract `UiPart` class, not shown in this diagram. You may refer to [this section](#patient-profile-gui-feature) to learn more about the `PatientProfile`.

A JavaFx `TableView` is used for the `PatientListPanel`. Styling for the `TableView` is done using the `TableView.css` file which is also in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/medibook/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `MediBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**Model**

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/medibook/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the medi book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Patient>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.
* `Name` and `Date` are packaged separately under CommonFields as they are used by multiple components within Model.

**Patient**

The `Patient`,
* stores `IC`, `Name`, `DateOfBirth` and `Phone` objects that represent the patient's IC number, name, date of birth and phone number respectively.
* stores `Optionals` of `Address`, `Email`, `Height`, `Weight`, `Bmi` and `BloodType` objects.
* stores a `MedicalNoteList` object which keeps track of `MedicalNote` objects belonging to the patient.
* `Bmi` is automatically computed and stored within Optional if both `Height` and `Weight` are present.
* stores `Allergy`, `Condition` and `Treatment` objects, where each patient can store any number of such objects.
* `Allergy`, `Condition` and `Treatment` are considered "medical details"/"medical tags", and inherit from the `Tag` class.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/medibook/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the medi book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the medical notes data in separate json file for each individual patient and read it back.
* can rename or delete the medical note data.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.medibook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Medical Notes

![Structure of MedicalNote Package (Higher Level)](images/MedicalNoteClassDiagram1.png)

The `MedicalNoteList`,
* stores `MedicalNote` objects belonging to a patient
* exposes a `ObservableList<MedicalNote>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* sorts `MedicalNote` objects from most recent to least recent using a `MedicalNoteComparator` object 

![Structure of MedicalNote Package (Lower Level)](images/MedicalNoteClassDiagram2.png)

The `MedicalNote`,
* stores `Date`, `Doctor` and `Content` objects that represent the date of creation, doctor who authored the note and content of the note.

### Adding medical notes to a patient

#### Implementation

* `AddNoteCommandParser` parses user's string input into a `AddNoteCommand`
* Target `patient` is retrieved from `ModelManager#getPatientToAccess()`
* `doctor` is retrieved from `ModelManager#getActiveUser()` 

The following sequence diagrams show how add medical note operation works:

![AddNoteSequenceDiagramMain](images/AddNoteSequenceDiagramFocusLogic.png)

![AddNoteSequenceDiagramSD](images/AddNoteSequenceDiagramSDUpdatePatientInModel.png)

Step 1. While on the patient's profile page and logged in as a doctor, the user inputs `addnote c/Patient...`.
The user input is handled by `LogicManager`, which then passes it to `MediBookParser` to be parsed.

Step 2. `MediBookParser` creates an instance of `AddNoteCommandParser` to parse the user input as a `AddNoteCommand`. 
It returns a `AddNoteCommand` object to `LogicManager`.

Step 3. `LogicManager` then executes the `AddNoteCommand` via `AddNoteCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. `AddNoteCommand#execute()` identifies the target `patient` object and the `doctor` authoring the note.
It then updates the model with the new medical note added to the patient using `Patient#addMedicalNote()`.

#### Design consideration

`addnote` command can only be called when viewing a `patient`'s profile (after an `access` command)

We have decided to implement `addnote` command this way for 2 reasons:
1. When user starts MediBook, not all `patient`s' list of medical notes would have been loaded into the program's memory. 
Only allowing `addnote` after `access` ensures that the patient's list of medical notes would have been loaded at that point.
2. It allows for a shorter `addnote` command as the user does not need to specify a target `patient`.

Elaboration on point 1:
* A medical records software contains many `patients`, each with potentially many `medical note`s.
* Every `patient` in the `model` has a `MedicalNoteList` that is initialised as an empty list at 
  program start-up to optimise start-up time
* `MedicalNoteList` of every patient is loaded only when necessary.
* `access`-ing a `patient` loads the stored medical note list and sets the `MedicalNoteList` of the `patient` to the retrieved list


### Deleting medical notes from a patient

#### Implementation

* The implementation of parsing of a `deletenote` command is similar to that of a `addnote` command.
* The general action of `DeleteNoteCommand#execute()` is similar to that of `AddNoteCommand#execute()`.
* A key difference is that the `DeleteNoteCommand#execute()` verifies that the logged in `Doctor`
is the same `Doctor` who authored the `MedicalNote` object before proceeding with the update.

The following sequence diagram highlights unique aspects of delete note operation:

![DeleteNoteSequenceDiagramModel](images/DeleteNoteSequenceModel.png)

Step 1. `LogicManager` executes the `DeleteNoteCommand` via `DeleteNoteCommand#execute()`.

Step 2. `DeleteNoteCommand` retrieves `displayedPatient` and `activeUser` from `ModelManager`.

Step 3. `DeleteNoteCommand` verifies that `activeUser` is the author of the target `noteToDelete` via `MedicalNote#isAuthoredBy(Doctor)`.
Note that an exception is thrown at this point if the author does not match `activeUser`.

Step 4. `DeleteNoteCommand` updates the model with the medical note deleted from the patient using `Patient#deleteMedicalNoteAtIndex(int)`.


### Editing medical notes of a patient

#### Implementation

* The implementation of `EditNoteCommand#execute()` makes use of `addnote` and `deletenote` implementations.

Step 1. `EditNoteCommand` identifies the target `MedicalNote` object.

Step 2. `EditNoteCommand` verifies that `activeUser` is the author of the target `MedicalNote`.
Note that an exception is thrown at this point if the author does not match `activeUser`.

Step 3. `EditNoteCommand` creates a new `MedicalNote` object based on `EditNoteDescriptor`.

Step 4. `EditNoteCommand` attempts to delete the target `MedicalNote` object and add the newly created `MedicalNote` object.
If the edit results in duplicates, an exception is thrown and no changes are made.


### Account creation and logging in

#### Account creation implementation

The account creation feature is facilitated by a new `CreateAccountWindow` class in the UI.

![CreateAccountSequenceDiagram](images/CreateAccountSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application and chooses the `Create Account` option. Then, the user inputs all of the required details.

Step 2. The UI calls `Logic#createAccount()` with the details input by the user.

Step 3. `Storage#createAccount()` converts the new account's username and password into json format and saves it in a `accounts.json` file.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user attempts to create an account.

![CreateAccountActivityDiagram](images/CreateAccountActivityDiagram.png)

#### Login implementation

The login feature is facilitated by a new `LoginWindow` class in the UI.

![LoginSequenceDiagram](images/LoginSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user inputs his/her login information.

Step 2. The UI calls `Logic#processLoginInfo()` with the login information as input.

Step 3. `Logic#processLoginInfo()` then calls `Storage#login()` on the login information, to check if the information matches any of the account details saved.

Step 4. If there is no match, an error is thrown. If there is a match, the UI then changes from `LoginWindow` to `MainWindow`, which signifies that the user has succesfully logged in.

#### Design consideration

We decided to implement this feature due to the nature of our application. Since it is intended for use by medical staff
and contains personal information for patients, the ability to protect such information is necessary. Thus, we came up with
this feature so that only valid users are able to use the system, thereby protecting the information of every patient
the system contains.

#### \[Proposed\] Admin accounts

Currently, the system is only capable of allowing the user to create new doctor's accounts. For all administrative staff,
there is only one account that they can use.

By allowing users to create either an admin account or a doctor account, the administrative staff would be allowed to
have a personalised account to use the system with. However, as there is no section of the application usable by
administrative staff that needs to keep track of the current user, this feature is low priority and we have not implemented
it.


### Enhanced find command

#### Implementation

`FindCommand` supports searching by substring for multiple fields with multiple keywords.
`FindCommand` is facilitated by `FindCommandParser` which creates one or more `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate`
(which implements the `Predicate<Patient>` interface) based on the user input.
Through the `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` objects that were created, `FindCommand` then calls 
`Model#updateFilteredPatientList(predicate)` to filter the list of patient in `Model` based on the user's input search query.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the `FindCommand` works.

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` 
and `FindCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches
the end of diagram.
</div>

Step 1. The user launches the application and inputs `find n/Steve Johnny i/S95 T00 d/2000 1995`.
This causes the `LogicManager#execute(String input)` method to be called.

Step 2. `MediBookParser#parseCommand(String input)` is then called, creating a new `FindCommandParser`.
`FindCommandParser#Parse(String arguments)` is then called and in the process, it creates one or more
`FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` instances(not shown in the sequence diagram). In this example, `FindCommandParser`
creates three `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` instance, corresponding to the three fields to be searched for.

Step 3. `FindCommand` is initialized with `List<Predicate<Patient>>` containing the `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate`
instances that were created in the previous step. This `FindCommand` instance in then finally returned as the result for
the `MediBookParser#parseCommand(String input)` method call.

Step 4. `FindCommand#execute(Model model)` is called and in turn, `FindCommand` calls the
`Model#updateFilteredPatientList(Predicate<Patient> predicate)` method which filters the list of
patient in `Model` based on user's input search query.

The diagram below illustrates the class diagram of the relevant classes for the find feature.

![FindClassDiagram](images/FindClassDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
`FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` implements the `Predicate<Patient>` interface.
</div>

`FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` is initialized with a `List<String>` containing the keywords to search for and `Prefix`
which determines which field of the patient to search for. When `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate#test(Patient patient)`
is called, it will check if each keyword is a substring of the specified field of the patient. So long as at least one
of the keyword passes the check, `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate#test(Patient patient)` will return true.

### Patient profile (GUI feature)
This feature allows the application to display a patient's details in a clean and readable fashion.

#### Implementation

The class diagram below details the full number of classes in the `PatientProfile` package, which is simplified in the [full UI diagram](#ui-component). 
This diagram shows only the classes used to display the patient profile, and the associations between these classes.
![PatientProfileClassDiagram](images/PatientProfileClassDiagram.png)

Notes: 
* All classes used to display a patient profile (shown in the above diagram) inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. 
Hence, they each represent a visible part of the UI.
* Some of these classes are dependent on the `Model` package which is shown in the [full UI diagram](#ui-component). 
Namely, `PatientProfile`, `PersonalDetailsCard`, `MedicalDetailsCard`, `MedicalNotesPanel`, `MedicalNoteCard` and `PatientChartCard`.
This is to retrieve the required information of a `patient`.

Classes used in this implementation can be described as follows:
* `PatientProfile` represents the whole component of the UI displaying the patient's profile. 
Each `PatientProfile` object contains a `PersonalDetailsCard`, a `MedicalDetailsCard` and a `MedicalNotesPanel`.
* `PersonalDetailsCard` represents a UI element displaying the personal details of a `patient`. 
It contains a JavaFX `ListView` displaying `PersonalDetailsRow` instances. 
The corresponding UI element is displayed on the top left of the `PatientProfile` UI element.
* `MedicalDetailsCard` represents a UI element displaying the medical details of a `patient`. 
It contains a JavaFX `ListView` displaying `MedicalDetailsRow` instances. 
The corresponding UI element is displayed on the bottom left of the `PatientProfile` UI element.
* `MedicalNotesPanel` represents a UI element displaying the `MedicalNote`s of a `patient`.
It contains a JavaFX `ListView` displaying `MedicalNoteCard` instances.
The corresponding UI element is displayed on the right of the `PatientProfile` UI element.
* `PersonalDetailsRow` represents a single `patient` personal detail. It provides the graphics for a row in the `ListView` of `PersonalDetailsCard`.
* `MedicalDetailsRow` represents a single `patient` personal detail. It provides the graphics for a row in the `ListView` of `MedicalDetailsCard`.
* `MedicalNoteCard` represents a single `MedicalNote`. It provides the graphics for an element in the `ListView` of `MedicalNotesPanel`.
`PatientChartCard` represents a UI element displaying the height, weight and BMI charts of a `patient`.

`PatientProfile` is displayed on the `MainWindow` when the `AccessCommand` is invoked. The following sequence diagram shows how accessing a `PatientProfile` works:
![AccessCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AccessCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
* When the access command is parsed, the `access()` command is called in the model so it remembers which patient is accessed.
* The `commandResult` is then passed all the way back up to the UI, where the `handleProfile()` method is called and `PatientList` UI region is changed to the `PatientProfile` region.

Thereafter, this next sequence diagram shows how displaying the `PatientProfile` works:
![PatientProfileSequenceDiagram](images/PatientProfileSequenceDiagram.png)

### `Context` interface

The `Context` interface acts as a way for MediBook to store the information pertaining to what command was just executed.
The main reason for needing a `Context` interface is due to the Command design pattern used in the application.

![ContextClassDiagram](images/ContextClassDiagram.png)

Referring to the class diagram above, `LogicManager` is dependent on `Model`, `Command` and `Storage`. Depending on the
command that was executed, `LogicManager` might want to call different methods from the `Storage` interface. For example,
if the user wants to edit the IC of a patient, `LogicManager` would want to call the method from `Storage` that would rename the
medical notes files of the patient to fit the newly updated IC.

However, due to polymorphism and the command design pattern, `LogicManager` does not know what command is being executed yet, it
needs to know this information in order to decide what to do next. The `Context` interface is thus implemented to solve this issue while
maintaining the command design pattern.

When any command that can affect the logic within `LogicManager` is executed (such as `EditCommand`, `AccessCommand` etc..), the relevant
command objects would call the relevant setter method from the class that implements the `Context` interface. `LogicManager` then retrieves
this information from that very same class, thereby solving the issue without causing any cyclic dependencies while maintaining the command design pattern.

Note:

Some of the commands that makes use of the `Context` interface are:
* `AccessCommand`
* `AddCommand`
* `AddNoteCommand`
* `ClearCommand`
* `DeleteCommand`
* `DeleteNoteCommand`
* `EditCommand`
* `EditNoteCommand`

### Charts and `Record` class

This feature allows MediBook to display charts of a patient's past height, weight and BMI records in the patient
profile page.

#### Implementation

The datapoints displayed on the charts are all obtained from the `Record` class. As seen in the [Model Component](#model-component) section,
a patient contains a single `Record` object in its field. The `Record` class contains two different `HashMap` that maps
a `Date` object to a `Height` or `Weight` object.

![RecordSequenceDiagram](images/RecordSequenceDiagram.png)

Everytime a command that updates a patient's `Height` or `Weight` is executed, the new `Height` or `Weight` would be added
to the `Record` object along with the current `Date`. This means that only `AddCommand` and `EditCommand` will actually update the patient's `Record`.
The sequence diagram above shows how a patient's `Height` or `Weight` is updated conditionally when an `EditCommand` is executed.
The sequence diagram for `AddCommand` would look similar to this diagram as well.

* Step 1: An inputs an `EditCommand` for example `edit n/John p/94347823 ...`.

* Step 2: MediBook then parses the input and executes it through the `EditCommand` object created.

* Step 3: The `EditCommand` object then retrieves the patient that is being edited from the `Model`.

* Step 4: The `EditCommand` object then checks if the `Height` or `Weight` of the patient was updated. If either one of the field
was updated, the `addHeightRecord` and `addWeightRecord` methods would be called in order to store the newly updated `Height`/`Weight`.
